- how i found the book
- why it interested me
   - i know little about the vietnam war
   - an old review was very critical, yet an author I trust recommended it
- overview
   - US + French intervention in Vietnam in the 50s
   - in the context of a love triangle involving a faceless Phuong, an aging Fowler, and naive Pyle
- thoughts
   - comments on the problems of US viewing the world as a set of conflicting ideologies which must be fought by force
   - conflicts are viewed at the philosophical level with little regard to the individual
   - this seems to be the main critique in Hitchen's *The Trial of Henry Kissinger*
   - its hard to comment

I first came across *The Quiet American* after finding [Andrew Bacevich's reading list](http://www.schaefersblog.com/andrew-bacevich-reading-list/).
His latest book *America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History* was the first book I bought after deciding to engage in US politics.
