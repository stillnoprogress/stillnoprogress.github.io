With two weeks until we vote, I would like to write a bit about the election, if only to document my understanding of it before the results come in. I hear from almost everyone that this is the 'most divisive' and 'ugliest' campaign they have seen in their lifetime. I am young and lacking first-hand knowledge of political history pre-9/11, so my first inclination is to take their word for it, but I'm not sure they've got it right. Donald Trump apparently scares many in the media with his politically-incorrect speech and policies, but it should come as no surprise. Donald is the candidate who is finally saying what The Right has been saying for years; he is bringing the politics of Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage to center stage.  

According to those In The Know, [Hillary Clinton is poised to win by a landslide](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-where-are-the-undecided-voters/).
