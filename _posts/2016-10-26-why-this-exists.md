I am starting this blog as a learning tool for myself. I want to learn to think and to write more clearly on topics I care about. There seem to be infinite voices competing for space in political discourse; I have no intention of being anything more than a small voice, but I feel compelled to exist in more than just my head.

During the past year's Presidential race, I have learned a lot. I have consumed more new information this election season than during any other time in my life. I have engaged with, and held my own against, people with vastly different perspectives than mine. I have found authors and thinkers I respect across the political spectrum, yet I don't think I absorbed as much as I should have. Arguments which seem so easy in my head often don't play out as well in real life. I find myself easily persuaded; though sometimes I convince myself it is a sign of empathy, a better explanation may be that I lack well-founded opinions. The point of this blog is to change that.

I hope to write about lots of things: books, current events, or anything I find interesting and want to learn more about. I am not a particularly strong writer, so I don't expect the content of this blog to be of much value to anyone else, but I'll welcome all comments and feedback.
